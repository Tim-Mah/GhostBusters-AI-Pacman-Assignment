# GhostBusters-AI-Pacman-Assignment
Pacman hunts invisible ghosts based on noisy readings of the Manhattan distance to each ghost. Goal: Pacman eats all the ghosts.

The Pacman AI projects were developed at UC Berkeley (http://ai.berkeley.edu).
The core projects and autograders were primarily created by John DeNero
(denero@cs.berkeley.edu) and Dan Klein (klein@cs.berkeley.edu). Student side autograding
was added by Brad Miller, Nick Hay, and Pieter Abbeel (pabbeel@cs.berkeley.edu).
Further modifications by Christian Muise at Queen's University

# Work
This assignment was about Bayes Nets and exact and approx. inference.
1. normalize(), sample(), getObservationProb(), observeUpdate(), elapseTime() functions in solutions.py
2. chooseAction() in bustersAgents.py
